# Vanderbilt SPC Web

Connects Home Assistant to a Vanderbilt SPC alarm panel via its built-in web interface.

Unlike the [official integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/spc/), it does not
require a gateway.

- Provides a global `alarm_control_panel` entity
- Supports "Armed away" / "Disarmed" states only
- Binary state sensors for all zones (motion/door detection)
- Enum sensors for zone status (tamper detection)
- State updates implemented by polling (configurable interval)

## Security

SPC panels use a **very old TLS implementation** that is considered unsafe nowadays.

The integration deliberately relaxes OpenSSL security settings to interface with the panel.

**Never expose your SPC panel to the public internet.**
Use this integration only on trusted local networks or via VPN.

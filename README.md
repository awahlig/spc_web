# Vanderbilt SPC (Web UI)

This integration connects Home Assistant to a Vanderbilt SPC alarm panel using its built-in web UI.

Unlike the [official integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/spc/), it does not
require a gateway.

- Provides an `alarm_control_panel` entity for **All Areas** only
- Supports "Armed away" / "Disarmed" states only
- State updates implemented by polling (configurable interval)
- Doesn't require a gateway

## Security

SPC panels use a **very old TLS implementation** that is considered unsafe nowadays.

The integration deliberately relaxes OpenSSL security settings to interface with the panel.

**Never expose your SPC panel to the public internet.**
Use this integration only on trusted local networks or via VPN.
